## ERROR IN DATA?!
### I think there is an ERROR in the hard_5_3.txt:
### It says that there are 5 roads and every Index in this file starts with 0.
### But at the lines starting with "M" up to ID 5 is used which will normally be 6 roads...

We try to solve the scheduling of road maintenance via Constraint Programming
